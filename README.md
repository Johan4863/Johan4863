<h1 align="left">Hello, Iâ€™m Johan.</h1>

<p align="left">I'm just casual programmer, I was in IT school but that's only thing that connecting me to coding, Rest of skills i have I've earned by self learning. I'm new in this type of work but if I would need to point what's I'm best in I would propably say in making Discord bots and Frontend. I've also was trying to create own games but it's ended with most clicked button being "Create New Project".I know some basics after doing it for 2 years but wanna learn more.</p>

<h2 align="left">Professional Goals</h2>

<p align="left">I'm looking to join someone's project to learn more from practice.I don't see myself working for some big company coz even if I'm programming for few years I'm still learning and compared to more advanced people in this I'm just beginner.</p>
